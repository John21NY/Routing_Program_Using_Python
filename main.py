There are fifteen packages on the truck1.  The majority of these packages are those that need to be delivered by
10:30 a.m, or packages that have a zip code near the packages with a delivery requirement

that have been delayed by the flight, and it also carries packages that have constraints, such as this package must be
transported in truck 2, etc.

Using this function to deliver the packages. The function uses two arguments, the truck that will leave the hub and the
time that the truck will leave the hub. I convert every String time to timedelta and I initialize the miles to zero, and 
the current address as 4001 South 700 East.I used two loops for this function, the first one to iterate through the
 packages and I looked up for the package id in the hashtable. Then I used a timedelta time object for the time the 
 package leaves the hub. In the second loop, I iterated in the packages and this time I computed the package id that 
 it's being delivered, and the distance that the truck has travelled. More calculations needed for the miles, the
  delivery time, and using the look up function for the delivered package. I set up again the timedelta, the delivery
   status, and for the second iteration I set up the package delivered address as current address. After this process, I
   remove the delivered package from the truck packages and the function returns the miles that the truck has travelled.
